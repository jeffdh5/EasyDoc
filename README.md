EasyDoc
=======

Light markup language inspired by jemdoc. 

This project, designed in Python, is meant to advance the principles of 
jemdoc while focusing on user interface for both the developer and the
viewer.

The CSS stylesheet included uses a very minimalist theme to create a
modern look consistent with the direction that web design is walking
towards.

An important feature of EasyDoc is that HTMl is automatically prettified,
something that jemdoc does not support.

Currently, I am finding ways to include LaTeX support that runs faster than
in jemdoc.. This is in the works, but hopefully a solution is to be found.

This is part of a larger project that will not be opensourced, so I hope
that this tool is able to help someone.
